## Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd

With the development of society, modern design elements are increasingly integrated into traditional garden design, forming a novel style fusion that improves both aesthetics and the sustainability of the social-ecological system. This study explores the application of style transfer algorithms to seamlessly integrate the aesthetics of traditional landscape paintings with virtual scenes of classical private gardens. The effectiveness of the method is verified through a series of experiments using virtual scenes of the Humble Administratorâ€™s Garden and various landscape paintings representing different artistic styles. The experimental results demonstrate that the style transfer technique can accurately replicate the aesthetic features of traditional paintings and integrate them into the virtual garden environment. This approach highlights the potential of combining cultural heritage with advanced technological methods, indicating that the technology has great potential to innovate garden design by promoting the synergy between cultural heritage and technological innovation. By promoting the integration of traditional aesthetics and modern design principles, we contribute to the sustainability and richness of the social-ecological system and provide a framework for future digital preservation and restoration applications of urban cultural heritage.

## Creating the Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd Environment

To create a virtual environment for the `Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd` project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Anaconda or Miniconda** if you haven't already. You can download it from [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda's website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2. **Create a new environment** named `Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd`:

    ```bash
    conda create --name Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd python=3.8
    ```

3. **Activate the environment**:

    ```bash
    conda activate Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd
    ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

    ```bash
    conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    pip install tensorflow keras
    ```

5. **Verify the installation**:

    ```bash
    python -c "import tensorflow as tf; import keras; print('Environment is ready!')"
    ```

This will set up the `Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd` environment with Python 3.8 and the necessary libraries.

## Running the Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd Project

Once the environment is set up, you can start running the project by following these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** (once the code is open-sourced):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd.git
    cd Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd
    ```

2. **Install any additional dependencies** listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the main script** to execute the style transfer experiments:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Visualize the results**:

    The output images and results will be saved in the `output/` directory. You can visualize them using any image viewer or open them in your preferred analysis software.
