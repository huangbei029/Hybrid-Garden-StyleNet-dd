# Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd

With the development of society, modern design elements are increasingly integrated
into traditional garden design, forming a novel style fusion that improves both
aesthetics and the sustainability of the social-ecological system. This study explores the
application of style transfer algorithms to seamlessly integrate the aesthetics of
traditional landscape paintings with virtual scenes of classical private gardens. The
effectiveness of the method is verified through a series of experiments using virtual
scenes of the Humble Administratorâ€™s Garden and various landscape paintings
representing different artistic styles. The experimental results demonstrate that the
style transfer technique can accurately replicate the aesthetic features of traditional
paintings and integrate them into the virtual garden environment. This approach
highlights the potential of combining cultural heritage with advanced technological
methods, indicating that the technology has great potential to innovate garden design
by promoting the synergy between cultural heritage and technological innovation. By
promoting the integration of traditional aesthetics and modern design principles, we
contribute to the sustainability and richness of the social-ecological system and provide
a framework for future digital preservation and restoration applications of urban
cultural heritage.



## Creating the Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd Environment

To create a virtual environment for the `Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd` project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Anaconda or Miniconda** if you haven't already. You can download it from [Anaconda's website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda's website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

2. **Create a new environment** named `Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd`:

    ```bash
    conda create --name Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd python=3.8
    ```

3. **Activate the environment**:

    ```bash
    conda activate Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd
    ```

4. **Install the required packages**:

    ```bash
    conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    pip install tensorflow keras
    ```

5. **Verify the installation**:

    ```bash
    python -c "import tensorflow as tf; import keras; print('Environment is ready!')"
    ```

This will set up the `Hybrid-Garden-StyleNet-dd` environment with Python 3.8 and the necessary libraries.
